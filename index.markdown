Santiago Borrazás résumé
========================

_Last updated 2018-06-14_


Santiago is a back-end and front-end software engineer specializing in
creating web applications.


# Goal

Create the best software and user experience to help people have a better life.


# Experience

1.  # Web.com
    
    ## Software engineer *May 2016 - now*
    
    Web.com is an American company that provides domain name registration and web development services to small and medium sized business.
    
    - Developed Website builder from its inception to production release. Currently used by thousands of users.

    - Drove the team's adoption of CSS Preprocessors, OOCSS, and linters. When the project grew in size and features I introduced the team to Less and Sass and how it could help to reuse and modularize the styles. We were using web components so using OOCSS was a natural choice. I taught the team how to write styles using BEM/SuitCSS conventions. This helped us to reduce the amount of bugs when introducing new UX. Moreover, I set up linters for Javascript and Less and other related tasks.

    - Dockerized the project. Given the micro-services architecture of the project, setting up the development environment in a new machine could take days and it wouldn't work on Windows. I used docker and docker-compose to automate the environment setup and provide an easy way of setting up the project.

    - Helped optimize page load time in different projects. I analyzed page speeds and used different techniques and tools to improve load times. I also removed Bootstrap as a dependency from generated websites in order to save bandwidth and make final websites lighter.

    - Chosen as team's Scrum Master
    
1.  # Automated trading system

    ## Software engineer *March 2015 - May 2016*

    Developed and maintained a system for running automated trading algorithms.
    Including:

    - Ported parts of the existing Java system to Jython (a Python
      implementation for the Java platform). We found that for
      many tasks, such as writing trading strategies or writing tests, Java was
      getting in our way. I created a test suite in Jython, ported a third of
      the existing tests, and ran the un-ported Java tests from the
      Jython test suite.

    - Created a tool to read production log files and generate charts using D3.
      This tool allowed us to compare production trading data against our
      simulations.

    - Developed a scraper to acquire economic data and use it in both our
      simulations and in our production code.

    - Analyzed market data to develop new algorithms.

    - Monitored the system to see if the trading strategy was performing as
      expected.

    We pair-programmed and used test-driven design (TDD).


1.  # Ekumen

    ## Web developer *December 2013 - March 2015*

    Worked for [Celery](https://www.trycelery.com) (a Y-Combinator backed
    startup that offers a platform for pre-orders) maintaining and developing
    new features in the dashboard app. Including:

    - Implemented a utility to help customer support migrate heterogeneous
      CSV files from clients and import the data into the platform.

    - Refactored many styles in the app, removing custom layouts and styles in
      favor of using Bootstrap components. These changes dramatically reduced
      the complexity of the stylesheets.

    - Thanks to the extensive use of Bootstrap, I was able to make several parts
      of the app mobile friendly.

    Used agile methodologies, we had planning meetings twice a month, daily
    scrums and telepresence.


1.  # 55Social

    ## Web developer *March 2013 – November 2013*

    55Social was a Facebook marketing platform. I worked on the publishing
    module developing new features and improving the existing codebase.

    - Implemented several features to help the company become
      a Preferred Marketing Developer (PMD) in the Facebook marketing partner
      program. These features included being able to send private messages with images and
      uploading video posts.

    - Used Spring and Hibernate to help fix bugs
      in the back-end of the publishing module.

    Worked with agile methodologies, with daily scrum meetings and monthly
    planning meetings.


1.  # Despegar.com

    ## Web developer  *September 2012 – March 2013*

    Worked in the front-end of the Auto section of [Despegar.com](http://www.despegar.com) (one of the most important travel websites in Latin America), implementing new features, including:

    - Developed a crawler-friendly version of the search section using
      PhantomJS. We would have preferred to generate these pages using Java, but
      the search section had complex logic (including rendering) in Javascript.
      Time was an important factor, and we delivered this in a few weeks.

    - Implemented several new features into the website such as a price comparison
      grid, improved the payment form, and added a car upselling feature, showing
      a better deal after having rented a car.

    - Introduced the team to several good practices such as code conventions
      and Javascript debugging.


1.  # Globant

    ## Web developer *October 2010 – September 2012*

    Designed and developed various web-based applications.

    - Built an example app for MySpace to demo how to use MySpace's Javascript
      API.

    - Worked on various internal apps for J. Walter Thompson (one of the
      most important international advertising agencies).
      Started to work with some new technologies back then: Backbone, Mustache,
      Handlebars, and Node.

    We used agile methodologies: daily scrum meetings and bi-monthly
    planning meetings. The code review process was a great tool.

      agency in PHP using CodeIgniter framework.
