    <p>Web.com is an American company that provides domain name registration and web development services to small and medium sized business.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Developed Website builder from its inception to production release. Currently used by thousands of users.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Drove the team’s adoption of CSS Preprocessors, OOCSS, and linters. When the project grew in size and features I introduced the team to Less and Sass and how it could help to reuse and modularize the styles. We were using web components so using OOCSS was a natural choice. I taught the team how to write styles using BEM/SuitCSS conventions. This helped us to reduce the amount of bugs when introducing new UX. Moreover, I set up linters for Javascript and Less and other related tasks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dockerized the project. Given the micro-services architecture of the project, setting up the development environment in a new machine could take days and it wouldn’t work on Windows. I used docker and docker-compose to automate the environment setup and provide an easy way of setting up the project.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Helped optimize page load time in different projects. I analyzed page speeds and used different techniques and tools to improve load times. I also removed Bootstrap as a dependency from generated websites in order to save bandwidth and make final websites lighter.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Chosen as team’s Scrum Master</p>
      </li>

    <h2 id="software-engineer-march-2015---may-2016">Software engineer <em>March 2015 - May 2016</em></h2>

    <p>Developed and maintained a system for running automated trading algorithms.
Including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Ported parts of the existing Java system to Jython (a Python
implementation for the Java platform). We found that for
many tasks, such as writing trading strategies or writing tests, Java was
getting in our way. I created a test suite in Jython, ported a third of
the existing tests, and ran the un-ported Java tests from the
Jython test suite.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Created a tool to read production log files and generate charts using D3.
This tool allowed us to compare production trading data against our
simulations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Developed a scraper to acquire economic data and use it in both our
simulations and in our production code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Analyzed market data to develop new algorithms.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Monitored the system to see if the trading strategy was performing as
expected.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We pair-programmed and used test-driven design (TDD).</p>

    <h2 id="web-developer-december-2013---march-2015">Web developer <em>December 2013 - March 2015</em></h2>

    <p>Worked for <a href="https://www.trycelery.com">Celery</a> (a Y-Combinator backed

new features in the dashboard app. Including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Implemented a utility to help customer support migrate heterogeneous
CSV files from clients and import the data into the platform.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Refactored many styles in the app, removing custom layouts and styles in
favor of using Bootstrap components. These changes dramatically reduced
the complexity of the stylesheets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Thanks to the extensive use of Bootstrap, I was able to make several parts
of the app mobile friendly.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Used agile methodologies, we had planning meetings twice a month, daily
scrums and telepresence.</p>

program. These features included being able to send private messages with images and
uploading video posts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>

in the back-end of the publishing module.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Developed a crawler-friendly version of the search section using
PhantomJS. We would have preferred to generate these pages using Java, but
the search section had complex logic (including rendering) in Javascript.
Time was an important factor, and we delivered this in a few weeks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Implemented several new features into the website such as a price comparison
